                                I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me<br/>
                                This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy<br/>
                                I need somebody to heal<br/>
                                Somebody to know<br/>
                                Somebody to have<br/>
                                Somebody to hold<br/>
                                It's easy to say<br/>
                                But it's never the same<br/>
                                I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Now the day bleeds<br/>
                                Into nightfall<br/>
                                And you're not here<br/>
                                To get me through it all<br/>
                                I let my guard down<br/>
                                And then you pulled the rug<br/>
                                I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br/>
                                <br/>
                                I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to<br/>
                                This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br/>
                                Now, I need somebody to know<br/>
                                Somebody to heal<br/>
                                Somebody to have<br/>
                                Just to know how it feels<br/>
                                It's easy to say but it's never the same<br/>
                                I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Now the day bleeds<br/>
                                Into nightfall<br/>
                                And you're not here<br/>
                                To get me through it all<br/>

                                And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes<br/>
                                I fall into your arms<br/>
                                I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around<br/>
                                <br/>
                                For now the day bleeds<br/>
                                Into nightfall<br/>
                                And you're not here<br/>

                                I've been holding onto hope<br/>
                                That you'll come back when you can find some peace<br/>
                                'Cause every word that I've heard spoken<br/>
